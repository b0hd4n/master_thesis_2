With increasing availability of computational resources and enormous amount of publicly available corpora it is now possible to obtain a MT system which produces translations of acceptable quality.
But in the use cases similar to conferences, where one speech is translated into multiple target languages, the same amount of models needs to be deployed. Another option is to use multilingual MT system for all needed languages together, which may lead to a decreased quality of translations. \par
